**Text-based games made easy**  
FlexTerm is aimed at people who love to type code in order to make, say text-adventure games, yet hate boilerplate with a burning passion. The library provides a variety of built-in TTFs to get you up and running as quickly as possible, but supports any font if you're feeling adventurous.

**Where did you get the fonts from?**  
Head over to **[int10h.org](https://int10h.org)** - there's a ton more high-quality fonts that you might have a use for if you're into retro themes. The text in the example project is also directly taken from the font preview on int10h. Additionally, you can find the font pack author's GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/viler-int10h).
